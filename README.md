# Optimization Algorithms and Machine Learning

Mostly interesting in fully programming 
(i. e. without the use of libraries that do it automatically)
different optimization algorithms, including constrained and unconstrained,
smooth and not smooth problems. Mostly convex optimization problems.

Optimization Algorithms folder is focused on implementing optimization algorithms
to solve optimization problems, whereas Machine Learning folder is there
to solve ML problems such as classification, regression, etc.
Of course the two are heavily linked, so to test optimization algorithms
I often use functions which also appear in ML.

Optimization algorithms are mostly taken from books such as J. Nocedal, S.
Wright's Numerical Optimization, S. Boyd's Convex Optimization, A. Gasnikov's
Universal Gradient Descent, S. Boyd's Stanford lectures on Convex Optimization
and Convex Optimization II. Some algorithms are taken from papers which I
collect myself.

Sometimes I leave the formulas used as screenshots, sometimes I leave reference
in the code, but often I do not. Keep in mind this is not a textbook,
but a repository with implementations because often it's a whole another
task to transform formulas into code for specific problems.

Machine Learning techniques are taken from a wide range of papers and lectures,
can't really list them all, but they're fairly well known. Data for problems
is provided in Excel files.

Data Structures folder is me trying out some data structures implementations
in Python, which of course isn't an optimal language for that kind of thing,
but nonetheless it's a useful experience.

Learning Python 1 folder is simply me trying out different features in python
or solving some exercises.
